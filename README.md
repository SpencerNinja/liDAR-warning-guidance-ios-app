# Sonic Bat

This is an app I built at a 24 hour coding competition, so please excuse me if it isn't complete.

This app uses LiDAR to detect the distance in front of the user. If the user comes close to a wall or object within the specified distance, then the app beeps and lights up.

The app was intended to help the visually impaired navigate. I wouldn't trust it to completely replace a blind-walking stick yet, as it still needs more work to be ready for the real-world.
